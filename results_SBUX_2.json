    "answer": "Based on the information provided in the SBUX's 10-K reports for both years 2023 and 2024, Starbucks Corporation is a multinational chain of coffee shops. Their primary business model revolves around operating company-owned stores and licensed stores, selling products such as Starbucks Doubleshot, foodservice products, and other branded items worldwide outside of their company-operated and licensed stores. They have partnerships with various companies like Nestlé, PepsiCo, Tingyi-Ashi Beverages Holding Co., Ltd., Arla Foods amba, for these collaborative relationships.\n\nThe majority of their revenues come from company-owned and licensed stores. In both 2023 and 2024, Starbucks had three reportable operating segments: North America (U.S. and Canada), International (China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Caribbean), and Channel Development.\n\nIn 2023, the mix of company-owned versus licensed stores in a given market varied based on factors like access to desirable local retail space, complexity, profitability, and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks. The same factors were noted for 2024.\n\nRevenue Components:\nIn both years, Starbucks generated the majority of their revenues through company-operated stores and licensed stores. \n\n- In 2023, the revenue components were as follows:\n\t+ Company-owned and Licensed Stores Summary: not specified.\n\t+ Revenue from reportable operating segments: North America (74%), International (21%), and Channel Development (5%).\n\n- In 2024, the revenue components were similar:\n\t+ Company-operated and Licensed Store Summary as of September 29, 2024: not specified.\n\t+ Revenue from reportable operating segments: North America (75%), International (20%), and Channel Development (5%).\n\nTherefore, Starbucks Corporation's primary business model is based on the operation of company-owned and licensed stores selling coffee, foodservice products, and branded items. They generate most of their revenue from these operations with North America being their largest contributor, followed by International and Channel Development segments.",

Unfortunately, there is no direct information available in the provided context about the revenue figures for both years. However, we can infer some details and make an estimation based on the given data:\n\n1. The total net revenues increased $201 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2023. This means that the revenue growth in 2024 compared to 2023 was 1%.\n2. The primary driver for this growth was higher revenues from company-operated stores ($304 million), which was due to incremental revenues from 1,426 net new company-operated stores over the past 12 months ($1.2 billion). This indicates that there has been a significant increase in the number of company-operated stores, leading to increased revenue.\n3. Partially offsetting this increase were a 2% decrease in comparable store sales ($629 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts ($235 million).\n4. For both the North America segment and U.S. market, revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. This growth was primarily driven by net new company-operated store growth over the past 12 months and higher product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees.\n5. The 2% decline in comparable store sales was partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket (primarily due to annualization of pricing).\n\nBased on this information, we can estimate that the year-over-year revenue growth for SBUX was approximately 1% from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024.",
