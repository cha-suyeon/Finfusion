# Unknown SEC 10-K QA Report

## Q1: What is the company’s primary business model and revenue drivers?

**Answer:**

Based on the information provided in the SBUX's 10-K reports for both years 2023 and 2024, Starbucks Corporation is a multinational chain of coffee shops. Their primary business model revolves around operating company-owned stores and licensed stores, selling products such as Starbucks Doubleshot, foodservice products, and other branded items worldwide outside of their company-operated and licensed stores. They have partnerships with various companies like Nestlé, PepsiCo, Tingyi-Ashi Beverages Holding Co., Ltd., Arla Foods amba, for these collaborative relationships.

The majority of their revenues come from company-owned and licensed stores. In both 2023 and 2024, Starbucks had three reportable operating segments: North America (U.S. and Canada), International (China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Caribbean), and Channel Development.

In 2023, the mix of company-owned versus licensed stores in a given market varied based on factors like access to desirable local retail space, complexity, profitability, and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks. The same factors were noted for 2024.

Revenue Components:
In both years, Starbucks generated the majority of their revenues through company-operated stores and licensed stores. 

- In 2023, the revenue components were as follows:
	+ Company-owned and Licensed Stores Summary: not specified.
	+ Revenue from reportable operating segments: North America (74%), International (21%), and Channel Development (5%).

- In 2024, the revenue components were similar:
	+ Company-operated and Licensed Store Summary as of September 29, 2024: not specified.
	+ Revenue from reportable operating segments: North America (75%), International (20%), and Channel Development (5%).

Therefore, Starbucks Corporation's primary business model is based on the operation of company-owned and licensed stores selling coffee, foodservice products, and branded items. They generate most of their revenue from these operations with North America being their largest contributor, followed by International and Channel Development segments.

## Q2: What were the total revenue and net income for the latest fiscal year?

**Answer:**

In 2023, total revenue was $3.7 billion and net income was not explicitly stated in the given context. For 2024, total revenue increased by 1% to $3.04 billion, but net income was also not explicitly provided in the given context.

## Q3: What was the year-over-year revenue growth?

**Answer:**

To determine the year-over-year revenue growth, we need to compare the revenues from the most recent year (2024) with that of the previous year (2023). Unfortunately, there is no direct information available in the provided context about the revenue figures for both years. However, we can infer some details and make an estimation based on the given data:

1. The total net revenues increased $201 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2023. This means that the revenue growth in 2024 compared to 2023 was 1%.
2. The primary driver for this growth was higher revenues from company-operated stores ($304 million), which was due to incremental revenues from 1,426 net new company-operated stores over the past 12 months ($1.2 billion). This indicates that there has been a significant increase in the number of company-operated stores, leading to increased revenue.
3. Partially offsetting this increase were a 2% decrease in comparable store sales ($629 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts ($235 million).
4. For both the North America segment and U.S. market, revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. This growth was primarily driven by net new company-operated store growth over the past 12 months and higher product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees.
5. The 2% decline in comparable store sales was partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket (primarily due to annualization of pricing).

Based on this information, we can estimate that the year-over-year revenue growth for SBUX was approximately 1% from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024.

## Q4: What are the top three risk factors disclosed in the report?

**Answer:**

1. Locate the section of the SEC 10-K filing titled "Risk Factors" or a similar heading that discusses potential risks to the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In this case, we need to look at the "Item 1A - Risk Factors" section across multiple years (2023 and 2024).

2. Identify the top three risk factors listed in this section, paying close attention to those that are most significant, pervasive, or recently updated. Look for specific language indicating their importance, such as "the most significant," "our primary risks," or other similar phrases.

For Year 2023:
1. Unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect our suppliers and licensees, which in turn could lead to supplier or licensee insolvency, increase our bad debt expense, or cause us to increase the levels of unsecured credit that we provide to suppliers and licensees. This could lead to supplier or licensee insolvency, increase our bad debt expense, or cause us to increase the levels of unsecured credit that we provide to suppliers and licensees.
2. Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results.
3. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea, and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean water and ice to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We continue to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require time and temperature control, including freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food-safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained during manufacturing, storage, distribution to stores, and at stores, due to mechanical malfunction or human error.

For Year 2024:
1. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea, and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean water and ice to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We continue to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require time and temperature control, including freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food-safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained during manufacturing, storage, distribution to stores, and at stores, due to mechanical malfunction or human error.
2. Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results.
3. Unfavorable economic conditions could also adversely affect our suppliers and licensees, who in turn could experience cash flow problems, more costly or unavailable financing, credit defaults and other financial hardships. This could lead to supplier or licensee insolvency, increase our bad debt expense, or cause us to increase the levels of unsecured credit that we provide to suppliers and licensees. Further, if any of our licensees becomes insolvent this could result in our exit from a particular market, and negatively impact our reputation. For example, one of our licensees is experiencing financial solvency issues, which may require the Company to expend capital resources to help fund their operating expenses in the short term.

In summary, the top three risk factors across both years are:
1. Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. (2023 and 2024)
2. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea, and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean water and ice to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We continue to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require time and temperature control, including freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food-safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained during manufacturing, storage, distribution to stores, and at stores, due to mechanical malfunction or human error. (Both in 2023 and 2024)
3. Unfavorable economic conditions could also adversely affect our suppliers and licensees, who in turn could experience cash flow problems, more costly or unavailable financing, credit defaults and other financial hardships. This could lead to supplier or licensee insolvency, increase our bad debt expense, or cause us to increase the levels of unsecured credit that we provide to suppliers and licensees. Further, if any of our licensees becomes insolvent this could result in our exit from a particular market, and negatively impact our reputation. For example, one of our licensees is experiencing financial solvency issues, which may require the Company to expend capital resources to help fund their operating expenses in the short term. (2023)

## Q5: What lawsuits or regulatory actions were disclosed in Item 3 or Item 8, and what is their estimated financial impact?

**Answer:**

To answer this question, we would need to access the SEC Form 10-K filings for Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) for the most recent fiscal year (2023). However, since these documents are not provided, I am unable to provide a specific response. 

Please provide the relevant SEC Form 10-K filing(s), and then follow the steps outlined in the instructions above to find any lawsuits or regulatory actions disclosed in Item 3 or Item 8 and their estimated financial impact.

## Q6: How did each operating segment perform (revenue, margins)?

**Answer:**

To answer this question, we need to follow the instructions and extract relevant information from the provided SBUX's 10-K reports for years 2023 and 2024.

1. Identify the operating segments of the company:
   - The report has three reportable operating segments: North America, International, and Channel Development.
   
2. For each identified operating segment, locate the relevant financial information such as revenue and margins (gross profit, operating income, etc.) within the 10-K filing.
   - Revenue for each segment:
     * In 2023, North America's revenue was not disclosed in the provided excerpt, International's revenue was also not mentioned, and Channel Development's revenue was not available either.
     * In 2024, North America's revenue was not disclosed, International's revenue was not disclosed, and Channel Development's revenue was not available.
   - Margins for each segment:

     * In 2024, there is no information provided on the gross profit, operating income, or any other margins for each segment.

Based on the available information, we cannot determine how each operating segment performed in terms of revenue and margins.

## Q7: How have operating cash flow (OCF) and free cash flow (FCF) trended?

**Answer:**

To answer your question about how operating cash flow (OCF) and free cash flow (FCF) have trended, we need to access the company's most recent SEC Form 10-K filing. Let's follow these steps:

1. Accessing the 10-K filing: The 10-K filings are available on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website or through financial databases such as EDGAR Online or S&P Global Market Intelligence. For this example, let's assume we are looking at Starbucks Corporation (SBUX).

2. Locating the Cash Flow Statement section: In the 10-K filing for SBUX, you would navigate to the "Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section. Within this section, you will find the Cash Flow Statement.

However, there is no cash flow statement provided in the given context from SBUX's 10-K report for years 2023 and 2024. It only contains information about internal controls, management discussion, and financial statements. Therefore, we cannot determine how operating cash flow (OCF) and free cash flow (FCF) have trended based on the provided context.

In order to answer this question, please provide the complete SEC Form 10-K filing for Starbucks Corporation (SBUX), specifically the "Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section, or any other relevant sections containing cash flow information.

## Q8: Did the company repurchase shares or issue dividends this year?

**Answer:**

Yes, the company both repurchased shares and issued dividends this year. In the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023, Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $1 billion on the open market. As of October 1, 2023, 42.6 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, SBUX's Board declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share to be paid on November 24, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 10, 2023. The total cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.

## Q9: Which macroeconomic risks (e.g., inflation, tariffs) are highlighted?

**Answer:**

In 2023, SBUX highlighted the following macroeconomic risks in their Risk Factors section:

1. Increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets
2. Inflationary pressures and changes in prevailing interest rates
3. Disruptions to their supply chain
4. Changes in governmental rules and approaches to taxation
5. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
6. Adverse outcomes of litigation
