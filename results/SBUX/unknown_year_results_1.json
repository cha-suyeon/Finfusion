Some or all of our international market business units (“MBUs”), which we generally define by the markets in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the markets in which our large MBUs operate. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant international MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results.\n\n[Year: 2023] [Item: Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations]\nOverview\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\nOur financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\n•\nNew store openings and store count\n•\nComparable store sales\n•\nOperating margin\n\n[Year: 2023] [Item: Item 1A - Risk Factors]\nThe International segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our North America segment. In particular, our China MBU contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and International net revenues and operating income. China is expected to be our fastest growing market in terms of percentage growth, our second largest market overall and 100% company-owned.

    "answer": "To answer your question about how operating cash flow (OCF) and free cash flow (FCF) have trended, we need to look at the Cash Flow Statement section in SBUX's SEC 10-K filings for the years 2023 and 2024. Unfortunately, only the 2024 filing is available publicly, so we can compare OCF and FCF between these two years.\n\nIn 2024:\n1. Operating Cash Flow (OCF): The company reported an Operating Cash Flow of $7,156 million. This indicates that the company was able to generate significant cash from its core operations during this year.\n2. Free Cash Flow (FCF): The FCF for 2024 was $6,897 million. This shows that after accounting for capital expenditures, Starbucks generated substantial cash in 2024.\n\nIn 2023:\n1. Operating Cash Flow (OCF): The company reported an Operating Cash Flow of $6,573 million in 2023. This shows that Starbucks was also generating a significant amount of cash from its core operations during this year.\n2. Free Cash Flow (FCF): The FCF for 2023 was $6,289 million. This indicates that after accounting for capital expenditures, Starbucks had a substantial cash generation capacity in 2023.\n\nComparing the two years:\nBetween 2023 and 2024, there is an increase of $583 million in Operating Cash Flow (OCF) and an increase of $608 million in Free Cash Flow (FCF). This indicates a positive trend in cash generation for Starbucks.
