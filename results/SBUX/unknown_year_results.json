This could include new product launches, expansion into new markets, or strategic partnerships.\n\n                Answer:",
    "answer": "The company's primary business model is operating coffee shops and selling coffee-related products. In fiscal year 2023, Starbucks generated the majority of its revenues through company-operated stores and licensed stores. The mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market varies based on several factors, including access to desirable local retail space, complexity, profitability, and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks.\n\nAccording to SBUX's 10-K reports from fiscal years 2023 and 2024, there are three reportable operating segments: North America, International, and Channel Development. In both years, the revenue distribution among these segments was as follows:\n\n- Fiscal Year 2024:\n\t+ North America (74% of total net revenues)\n\t+ International (21%)\n\t+ Channel Development (5%)\n- Fiscal Year 2023:\n\t+ North America (74% of total net revenues)\n\t+ International (21%)\n\t+ Channel Development (5%)\n\nIn both years, the company's primary revenue drivers are its North America and International segments. These segments sell coffee and other beverages, complementary food, packaged coffees, single-serve coffee products, and a focused selection of merchandise through company-operated stores and licensed stores.\n\nThe Channel Development segment contributes less to the overall revenue but still plays an important role in the company's business model. This segment includes packaged coffee, tea, foodservice products, and ready-to-drink beverage sales to customers outside of company-operated and licensed stores. A large portion of this segment operates under a licensed model of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, while global ready-to-drink businesses operate under collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Tingyi-Ashi Beverages Holding Co., Ltd., Arla Foods amba, Nestlé and others.\n\nIn terms of future growth opportunities, the 10-K mentions strategic partnerships and expansion into new markets. For instance, SBUX has collaborative relationships with various companies for its ready-to-drink businesses, such as PepsiCo, Tingyi-Ashi Beverages Holding Co., Arla Foods amba, Nestlé, etc. These partnerships enable the company to reach a broader customer base and potentially increase revenue. Additionally, the company is continuously looking for opportunities to expand its store presence in existing markets and explore new geographic regions.",

We can find the SEC 10-K filings for SBUX by searching for \"Starbucks\" within all available 10-K filings.\n\nOnce we have the relevant filings, we need to locate the section in the 10-K that provides information on the operating cash flow (OCF) and free cash flow (FCF) of the company. This information is typically found under the \"Statement of Cash Flows\" or \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" sections.\n\nFor the year 2023, according to Starbucks' 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2023:\n\nUnder the \"Statement of Cash Flows\" section:\n- Net cash provided by operating activities (OCF) was $4.8 billion.\n- Free cash flow (FCF) was not explicitly mentioned, but we can calculate it as follows: FCF = Net cash provided by operating activities - Capital expenditures. In 2023, capital expenditures were $1.1 billion, so FCF would be approximately $4.8 billion - $1.1 billion = $3.7 billion.\n\nFor the year 2024, according to Starbucks' 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2024:\n\nUnder the \"Statement of Cash Flows\" section:\n- Net cash provided by operating activities (OCF) was $5.0 billion.\n- Free cash flow (FCF) was not explicitly mentioned, but we can calculate it as follows: FCF = Net cash provided by operating activities - Capital expenditures. In 2024, capital expenditures were $1.2 billion, so FCF would be approximately $5.0 billion - $1.2 billion = $3.8 billion.\n\nComparing the two years:\n\nIn both 2023 and 2024, Starbucks' OCF increased from $4.8 billion in 2023 to $5.0 billion in 2024. The FCF also increased from approximately $3.7 billion in 2023 to approximately $3.8 billion in 2024.
